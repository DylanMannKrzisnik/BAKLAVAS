"""Target-aware ST feature-panel restriction for spatialMETA/SpatialJEPA training.

At transfer time the SpatialJEPA RNA encoder is frozen to the ST genes chosen at
training time. When the model is applied to a different target (e.g. human SEA-AD
snRNA-seq / MERFISH), genes the target does not measure are zero-filled, which
degrades the encoder input -- badly for small targeted panels like MERFISH.

This module restricts the joint AnnData's ST features to a ranked target panel
*before* spatial-variability selection, so the trained model only keeps ST genes the
target also measures. The companion generator (``Lipid_GP/build_target_gene_ranking.py``)
produces the ranked panel CSV; here we only consume it.

Matching is case-insensitive on the bare gene symbol (the SMA source is mouse, e.g.
``Snca``; SEA-AD targets are human, e.g. ``SNCA``), mirroring the uppercase tokenization
used by the inference worker (``embed_with_spatialmeta.feature_tokens``).
